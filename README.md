# Interface between QuiltData and Pachyderm

This is my Data Engineering project at the [Insight Data Science program](http://insightdataengineering.com/). It is on the consulting project from [QuiltData](https://quiltdata.com/) to implement an automatic interface in building data pipeline and processing large amount of data in parallel with [Pachyderm engine](http://pachyderm.io/).

This document serves two purposes:
- Describe my project to general audience
- Describe the technical usage and implementation to QuiltData
